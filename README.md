# Face-Mask-Detector


Real-time COVID-19 face mask detector with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning. The model uses the MobileNetV2 architecture,
it's also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems.

If classifies people in images and videos if they have work a proper mask or not.

Dataset used: masked_images - 320 images(with augumented images)
              no_mask_images - 320 images(with augumented images)
